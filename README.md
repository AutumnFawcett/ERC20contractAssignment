# ERC20contractAssignment
This is my ERC20 Contract Assignment...where I take "My First ERC20 Contract" and modify it as instructed in the ZTM Blockchain Developer Course.

Assignment: 
- Extend the ERC20 contract with one function
- Add a 1% fee to the transfer function. The fee will be added to the balance of an address defined in the Smart Contract state
- First deploy it to a local blockchain in Remix. Use our giveMeOneFullToken function. And test if the fee works. Then try to deploy this contract via Remix on a public testate, e.g. Sepolia
